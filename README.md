# Tweet-Based-Sentiment-Analyzer
People today express their opinions regarding any particular topic or issue widely on social media. One
such popular social media platform amongst masses is twitter with over 320 million monthly users. Users also
express their thoughts on any political announcements or decisions taken by a particular party. Analyzing these
tweets on a specific topic can help determining what people think about measures undertaken by the government.
It will give an idea on how many percent of people are in favour of any announcement and how many of them
stand against it. This will in turn provide areas of improvement for the ruling or opposition party. This project thus
aims on finding sentiments of tweets on a political leader, some party or announcements like a union budget. This
can further be generalized to any particular measure undertaken by any organization.
